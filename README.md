Autocorrector Feature using NLP in Python

An implementation of an autocorrector — a Natural Language Processing tool that can automatically correct spelling mistakes in input text. Built in Python using foundational NLP techniques such as tokenization and word frequency modeling.

This project demonstrates how to build a simple, yet effective, autocorrect system from scratch. It is suitable for learning NLP fundamentals and for use in applications like chatbots, text editors, and search interfaces.

**Features**

1. Detects and corrects simple spelling errors
2. Uses word frequency and edit distance techniques
3. Works on individual words and multi-word sentences
4. Easy to extend with custom corpora
